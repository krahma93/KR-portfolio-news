If you want to clone this project and run it locally you will need to create two .env files for your project: `.env.test` and `.env.development`. Into each, add `PGDATABASE=<database_name_here>`, with the correct database name for that environment (see `/db/setup.sql` for the database names). Double check that these .env files are .gitignored.
