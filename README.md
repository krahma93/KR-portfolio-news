## Introduction

This API project (https://kr-news-portfolio.onrender.com/api/) has been built for the purpose of accessing data programatically. This data will be accessed from the following front-end project: (https://github.com/krahma93/NC-News-FE)

## The API has available the following endpoints:

- GET /api
- GET /api/topics
- GET /api/users
- GET /api/articles
- GET /api/articles/:article_id
- PATCH /api/articles/:articles_id
- GET /api/articles/:article_id/comments
- POST /api/articles/:article_id/comments
- DELETE /api/comments/:comment_id

# Note: GET /api/articles endpoint accepts the following queries:

- sortBy, which sorts the articles by any valid column (defaults to date)
- order, which can be set to asc or desc for ascending or descending (defaults to descending)
- topic, which filters the articles by the topic value specified in the query

## Installation

Development dependencies

- express
- dotenv
- pg
- pg-format

## Testing dependencies

- jest

- jest-extended

## Creating .env files

Please, bear in mind that after cloning this repo you won't have access to the necessary environment variables. Therefore, in order to successfully connect locally to the two databases, two .env files must be created.

Within the .env.development and .env.test files you need to add PGDATABASE=<database_name_here> with the correct database name.

- Development database name: nc_news

- Test database name: nc_news_test

## Seeding local database

In order to seed the databases, the following commands need to be run:

- npm run setup-dbs
- npm run seed

## Running tests

The following command will run the tests:

- npm test app

Note: Test dependencies are assumed to have already been installed after running npm install when installing the development dependencies.
